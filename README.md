# hello-world
First Repository. 
I am learning to use GitHub so I can start creating a portfolio and hopefully get a software developer job by June.
I have a decent base of coding knowledge but tend to watch tutorials of the same shit over and over instead of working on
actual projects. I'm going to create simple projects to start and learn what I need to as I make more complex projects until
hopefully I have the ability to create an entire software package, maybe something like a video game.
